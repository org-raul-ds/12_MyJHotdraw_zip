# My JHotDraw 5.1

This repository is based on [JHotDraw5.1](http://members.pingnet.ch/gamma/JHD-5.1.zip) with some minor modifications required for my own classes.

Changes made:
- The example "CH.ifa.draw.samples.nothing" has been simplified to demonstrate how the framework looks before inserting anything. It is the minimal application.
- An example of a basic UML class diagram editor has been added in "ric\jhotdraw\UML\draw".
- Bat files have been added to run the standalone version of all examples.
- The HTML files to launch the examples in applet version have been removed, as applets are no longer supported.
